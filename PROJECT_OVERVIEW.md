# MMGI Project Overview
## What Each Component Does

This document provides a high-level explanation of every component in the MMGI (Multi-Modal Gesture Intelligence) project, describing **what** each part does without diving into code implementation details.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

MMGI is a **hand gesture recognition system** that allows you to control your Windows computer using hand gestures captured through your webcam. The system can:
- Detect and track your hands in real-time
- Recognize specific hand gestures
- Map gestures to computer actions (launching apps, controlling media, adjusting volume)
- Execute those actions safely with an activation system

---

## 📁 Project Structure Overview

### **main.py** - The Orchestra Conductor
This is the central control file that brings everything together. It:
- Initializes all the system components
- Runs the main loop that captures camera frames continuously
- Coordinates between all modules (camera → hand detection → gesture recognition → action execution)
- Handles user input (keyboard shortcuts like 'q' to quit, 'f' for fullscreen)
- Manages the lifecycle (startup, running, cleanup)

**Why it matters**: This is where everything connects. Without this orchestrator, all the individual components would work in isolation.

---

## 🔧 Core Modules (`core/` folder)

These modules handle the fundamental detection and recognition capabilities.

### **camera.py** - The Eyes
**What it does**:
- Opens and manages your laptop's webcam
- Captures video frames continuously (30 times per second)
- Provides frame data to other components
- Handles camera cleanup when closing the program

**Think of it as**: A dedicated camera operator that never stops recording.

---

### **hand_tracking.py** - The Hand Detective
**What it does**:
- Uses MediaPipe AI technology to find hands in camera frames
- Identifies 21 specific points (landmarks) on each hand (fingertips, knuckles, wrist, etc.)
- Draws the hand skeleton visualization on screen (those colorful dots and lines)
- Determines which fingers are up or down
- Distinguishes between left and right hands
- Supports tracking up to 2 hands simultaneously

**Key capabilities**:
- **Hand Detection**: "Is there a hand in this image?"
- **Landmark Tracking**: "Where exactly are the fingertips, knuckles, and wrist?"
- **Finger State Analysis**: "Which fingers are pointing up vs curled down?"
- **Handedness**: "Is this the left hand or right hand?"

**Think of it as**: A specialized detective that can spot hands and analyze their exact position and configuration.

---

### **gesture_classifier.py** - The Pattern Recognizer
**What it does**:
- Takes the finger state information (which fingers are up/down)
- Matches patterns to identify specific gestures
- Displays the recognized gesture name on screen

**Gestures it recognizes**:
1. **Open Palm** - All 5 fingers extended (used for activation)
2. **Fist** - All fingers closed (used for deactivation)
3. **Thumbs Up** - Only thumb extended
4. **One Finger** - Only index finger up (pointing)
5. **Two Fingers** - Index and middle fingers up (peace sign)
6. **Three Fingers** - Index, middle, and ring fingers up
7. **Ring and Pinky** - Only ring and pinky fingers up
8. **Pinky** - Only pinky finger up

**Think of it as**: A translator that converts hand positions into meaningful gesture names.

---

## ⚙️ Engine Modules (`engine/` folder)

These modules handle the "business logic" - the decision-making and action execution.

### **activation_manager.py** - The Safety Gatekeeper
**What it does**:
- Manages the system's ON/OFF state
- Requires you to hold "Open Palm" for 2 seconds to turn ON (prevents accidental activations)
- Allows instant OFF with a "Fist" gesture
- Ensures gestures are stable (not flickering) for 10 frames before accepting them
- Implements a 1-second cooldown between actions (prevents accidental repeated actions)
- Shows visual feedback with a status panel and progress bar

**Safety features**:
- **Activation Delay**: Must hold Open Palm for 2 full seconds
- **Stability Check**: Gesture must be consistent for at least 10 frames
- **Cooldown Period**: 1-second wait after each action
- **Visual Status**: Always shows whether system is INACTIVE, ACTIVATING, or ACTIVE

**Think of it as**: A security guard that ensures you really mean to trigger an action before allowing it.

---

### **decision_engine.py** - The Strategy Planner
**What it does**:
- Loads the gesture-to-action mapping from the configuration file
- Determines which computer action should be executed for a given gesture
- Implements hand-specific logic (different actions for left vs right hand)
- Provides fallback behavior when only one hand is detected

**Mapping strategy**:
- **Right Hand**: Controls applications and media navigation
  - One Finger → Open Brave Browser
  - Two Fingers → Open Apple Music/Spotify
  - Ring + Pinky → Next Song
  - Pinky → Previous Song

- **Left Hand**: Controls audio and playback
  - One Finger → Volume Up
  - Two Fingers → Volume Down
  - Three Fingers → Mute
  - Pinky → Play/Pause

**Think of it as**: A dispatcher that decides which action should happen based on which gesture you showed and which hand made it.

---

### **action_executor.py** - The Action Performer
**What it does**:
- Actually executes the computer actions (launches apps, presses media keys, adjusts volume)
- Uses PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard presses and system commands
- Handles Windows-specific paths and commands
- Shows visual feedback on screen when an action is executed
- Implements error handling for failed actions

**Actions it can perform**:
- **Launch Applications**: Open Brave browser, Spotify, Apple Music
- **Media Control**: Next track, previous track, play/pause
- **Volume Control**: Increase, decrease, mute/unmute
- **System Commands**: Various keyboard shortcuts and system controls

**Think of it as**: The hands (literally!) that press the buttons and execute commands on your behalf.

---

## 🛠️ Utility Modules (`utils/` folder)

These modules provide supporting functionality.

### **fps_counter.py** - The Performance Monitor
**What it does**:
- Tracks how many frames per second the system is processing
- Calculates and displays FPS on screen
- Provides performance feedback to ensure smooth operation

**Why it matters**: 
- Helps you verify the system is running smoothly (target: ~30 FPS)
- Indicates if your computer is struggling (low FPS might mean performance issues)

**Think of it as**: A speedometer for your gesture recognition system.

---

### **config.py** - The Settings Manager
**What it does**:
- Loads configuration settings from JSON files
- Provides default values if configuration files are missing
- Centralizes all configurable parameters
- Allows easy adjustment of system behavior without changing code

**Settings it manages**:
- Camera resolution and frame rate
- Hand detection confidence thresholds
- Activation timing parameters
- Display preferences (what to show/hide)
- Application paths

**Think of it as**: A control panel where all adjustable settings live.

---

- **FPSCounter** starts tracking performance

### 2. **Main Loop (runs 30 times per second)**
   1. **Camera** captures a new frame
   2. **HandTracker** analyzes frame for hands
   3. If hand(s) found:
      - **HandTracker** draws landmarks on frame
      - **HandTracker** determines finger states
      - **HandTracker** identifies handedness (left/right)
      - **GestureClassifier** recognizes gesture from finger states
      - **ActivationManager** checks if gesture should activate/deactivate system
      - If system is ACTIVE and not in cooldown:
        - **DecisionEngine** determines which action to execute
        - **ActionExecutor** performs the action
        - **ActivationManager** starts cooldown timer
   4. **FPSCounter** updates performance metrics
   5. All visual feedback is drawn on frame
   6. Frame is displayed in window
   7. Check for user input (q/ESC to quit, f for fullscreen)

### 3. **Cleanup Phase**
- **Camera** releases webcam
- **HandTracker** closes MediaPipe resources
- Windows are destroyed
- Program exits gracefully
